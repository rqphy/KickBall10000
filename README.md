# Mother's Soccer

I created a simple 3d football game with threejs. Shoot the ball and aim at the targets !
I wanted to experiment [CANNON.js](https://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js/) (a library that add physics to your ThreeJs world). I gave myself 1 week to complete this challenge. The design was made by a coworker at [Wonderstudios](https://wonderstudios.com/).
